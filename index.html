            <p class="first-p">Me?...Mr.Attitude. <br> You might saw me jumping, climbing buildings, and stopping
                trains. But nobody pays me a
                dime
                for that work. That's why I am learning and mastering web development. I will not stop until I become
                the
                Web Development Hero.</p>

                <p>They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web developer. I made their website and
                    showed
                    it to them. They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.</p>
